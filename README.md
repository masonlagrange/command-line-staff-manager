# Command Line Staff Manager

## Description
This project was made to learn how to update databases using SQL and integrate queries into a commmand line program. During development I learned the importance of classes and understanding how to work with SQL queries.

## Installation
Clone the Git repo to your local machine, run npm i in the root folder. Log in to mysql and use the "source db/schema.sql" command, followed by the "source db/seeds.sql" command.

## Usage
Run the program with "node index" from the command line then choose which options you want to use and fill in the prompted fields. Databases will be updated with the corresponding information.
